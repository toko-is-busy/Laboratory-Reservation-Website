🧪 Laboratory Reservation Website
=================================

A Node.js + Vue web application for managing laboratory reservations. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and MongoDB for data storage.

⚠️ Note: The database hosted on MongoDB Atlas is currently not running. Pages that rely on database interactions (e.g., login, registration, reservations) will not function properly until the database connection is restored.

1. Clone the Repository:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Laboratory-Reservation-Website.git
    cd Laboratory-Reservation-Website

2. Navigate to the backend folder:
    cd node

3. Install Dependencies:
    npm install

4. Start the Server:
